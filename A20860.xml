            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">E</seg>VEN til this preſent, great is my affection towards you (Worthy Companie of the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalitie of the Bleſſed Virgin Marie, Noble in linage, leatning, and vertue) nor is there anie thing I more deſire, then very much to profit you; ſeing I haue receaued very much from you; that al in fine may returne to the ſelf-ſame fountaines from whence it firſt ſprang. Whatſoeuer in my youth I gained in learning or Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie I aſcribe to the Sodalitie of the moſt Bleſſed Virgin, and this I

Inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuouſly I confeſſe, had it not been for your ſodalitie. I had perished and many others with me. But hardly can a man perish amongſt you, vnles he wholy withdraw his mind from you, and wil fully caſt himſelf into perditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. My opinion is, that no ſtudent in the Schooles profits in learning, except by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming himſelfe with you, he firſt learne this one thing; how, and with what ſobrietie he ought to learne. Vertue is both the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of other things and her ſelfe.

<pb facs="tcp:10473:7"/>
this other treatiſe as a ſlender mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nument of my grateful mind.</p>
            <p>The title of this booke is <hi>Trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phata Incontinentia, The Triumph ouer Incontinencie.</hi> Let no man here make an euil interpretation, for that it is dedicated to you, as if any of you were burnt with inconti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nencie: there is no ſuch meaning, but to the intent it may not burne you. For as we make a medicine, that may be a remedy to ſome, an eaſe to others, and an antidote to the reſt; ſo the vices being remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, we muſt learne by what mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes to auoid the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in time to come. And for that it is very difficult to purge &amp; purifie mens ſoules tain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with an inueterate diſeaſe, it is a point of great prouidence, in him who hath once receaued a Medicine, to be no leſſe careful in recouering health then preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing.
<pb facs="tcp:10473:7"/>
To this end doth this booke ſo readily addreſſe it ſelfe to you, to preuent (for I preſume there is no need to take away) the diſeaſe of Incontinency. Now why pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent I not a booke of greater bulke? a guift more graceful and ſeemely then this is, I grant. But beare I beſeech you with the ſlen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der abilitie of the giuer, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe with the vices of our Age, which if you ſeriouſly take a view of, you wil not deny there are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie impurities &amp; great corruptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of manners now in euerie place; you wil freely acknowledged, the world growne ſicke, and chiefly of incontinencie. We muſt not ſet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a ſicke man great morſels, or groſſe meat in large platters; but rather nurſe him vp with little pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tances of lighteſt meates and ſmal meſſes of potage. The Same muſt
<pb facs="tcp:10473:8"/>
we doe in this caſe. And if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the Genius of this Age, the world can hardly now be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe cured.</p>
            <p>Volumes &amp; prolixe bookes this faſtidious Age hardly wil digeſt: wherefore wee muſt now in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner curſorily intimate thoſe things which are wholeſome. Compen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious bookes &amp; briefe diſcourſes although not ſo polite may with leſſe difficultie correct thoſe that are forgetful of honeſtie: But whatſoeuer others haue ſaid or written, this vice of incontinencie ought to be purſued without meane or meaſure; for it is exceſſiue without bound or limit. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe incontinencie (a pleaſing but peſtilent venom) infecteth the moſt part of the world I could wish that manie might partake of this medicinal booke, which of
<pb facs="tcp:10473:8"/>
right ought to be short, leſt the malady it should cure, by lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gring, be rather more and more encreaſed. Beſides if I reſpect the Sodalitie of the moſt Bleſſed Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin (for whoſe honour, and good this little booke is written) I ought not to make tedious exhortations. There is a certaine kind of men, ſo docible, that they learne thoſe things that are taught them, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any long inſtruction, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend good things, ſo ſoone as they heare them. Theſe ſo capable of vertue, &amp; wel deſpoſed of their owne accord, are ordinarie in the familie of the Moſt Bleſſed Virgin.</p>
            <p>Wherefore I beſeech you, (my moſt intirely beloued Aſſociates) vouchſafe this little booke of my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne, the entertainment of a new gueſt: it requires not any exqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite entreatie; but ſuch as you are
<pb facs="tcp:10473:9"/>
wont not to deny bookes of pietie. And for that I make no queſtion, but you are feruently in loue with chaſtity, and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nencie, I am confident you wil with fauourable eyes, and eares accept this preſident of <hi>Nicetas</hi> triumphing ouer incontinencie. So I moſt humbly recommend my ſelfe to al your chaſt prayers. From <hi>Monachium</hi> the day of the purifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the moſt Bleſſed Virgin the yeare of Chriſt 1624.</p>

weapons, yet could not be ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come: yea he heard and came nere, or at leaſt was compelled to come nere the moſt deceitful Siren, yet was he not drowned. His tongue fought, his tongue ouercame, whereby we are al in a manner vanquished. Yet this did he not by volubilitie of ſpeech, but by a painful mayming of his tongue. Wouldeſt thou know (Reader) the vncomparable proiect of this moſt generous Nicetas? read this little booke; but let me requeſt thee to read it with repoſe &amp; recollection of mind, willing to reape benefit thereby. Our endeauour here is to compoſe manners not words, to profit mens ſoules, not to pleaſe their eares. The ſcope of my wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting is, that which I deſire should be likewiſe thyne in reading, to deſtroy the extreameſt of al euils, the moſt capital of al plagues, the

deepeſt ſourſe of al vices <hi>(Inconti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nency)</hi> the pregnant mother of al ſinnes, diffuſing herſelfe into al shapes. He that is an enemie to chaſtitie, is in a manner a friend to al vices. Neuer was there anie man denounced warre againſt chaſtitie who had not firſt entred a league with more then one enormitie. Whoſoeuer is minded compen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diouſly to attaine to the knowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge of vices, let him but make himſelfe a ſcholler to Laſciuiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, and he shal shortly won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to ſee himſelfe of a ſcoller be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a maiſter. No man can liue vertuouſly if he liue not chaſtly. And (good Reader) deceaue not thy ſelfe, it is not for yong men only theſe things are written, not for Virgins, nor thoſe only of the Sodalitie who are batchlours. This belo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>geth to euery ſtate, Sex,

Hardly shal he keepe the lawes of wedlocke who knowes not how to preſerue thoſe of chaſtity. Yea I dare boldly avouch, that man muſt haue an exact knowledge of the lawes of chaſtity, who wil obſerue thoſe of wedlocke. It is not lawful for any order of men, of what age ſoeuer to goe beyond the bounds of chaſtitie. How can a man agree wel with vertue, who is at variance with modeſtie, the onlie feat of vertue? So that theſe things which are ſaid of auoyding inco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinencie are neceſſarie for euerie one to know.

PARTHENIVS. But it is not required at our hands, that with a dagger we should wound or thruſt out our eyes: shut them and thou haſt pulled them out; reſtraine them and thou haſt throwne them from thee.

This man (my EDESIMVS.) this man we may wel cal the Maſter of his eyes; who, as it manifeſtly appeareth, had gotten a great conqueſt ouer himſelf in al his affections. The weaker Sex are nothing inferiour to men. <hi>Sara</hi> was an Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beſſe of holy Nunnes in the Scythiotick monaſterie, ſituated in a pleaſant place, neere to which a very cleere riuer gently glided, the ſtreame whereof free from al madde crept along, and shined with chriſtalline waters, through which though deepe, euery little ſtone might be numbred. This mild riuulet was decked with verdant bancks moſt cheerful to behold. Whoſoeuer ſaw, commended this ſo ſoftly ſtealing riuer. Sara often heard the commendation of this ſiluer ſtreame: and, as many times it cometh to paſſe, the multitude of commenders begate in her a deſire to ſee it. But she

shal not be improued by vertuous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſation, but rather the vicious wil corrupt &amp; contaminate the good.

                  <hi>Our manners are deriued from them with whom we conuerſe, and as certaine diſeaſes of the body are taken by touching, ſo the mind imparts it's vices vnto the next neighbour.</hi> A drunkard draweth them that liue with him to the loue of wine: a man that is valiant and hardy ſoone dege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerates through the company of thoſe that are wanton and effeminate: and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uetouſneſſe to thoſe that conuerſe with her transferreth her poiſon.

vnto vs, make an impreſſion of it in vs, or before we are aware infect vs there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with. There are ſome vices commended by example, others imprinted by ſpeech, and very many by conuerſation inſerted in our harts. It is the ſafeſt courſe to beware of al thoſe companions and freinds that are of a ſuſpected life, and to breake with them as ſpeedily as you can. He that continueth nere danger cannot long be ſafe; and who loueth danger shal perish therin.</p>

Not many yeares ſince I went to ſee a certaine Aunt of mine, a religious woman in a poore monaſtery and falling into talke with her I asked how many

In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>continency inuadeth our fame &amp; vertues: that ſhe tainteth, theſe she extirpateth. With good cauſe may I heere vſe the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des of <hi>S. Hierom: O Luxury, o thou infernal fire; whoſe fuel is gluttony, whoſe flame pride, whoſe ſparkes lewd ſpeeches, whoſe ſmoke in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famy, whoſe ashes vncleanneſſe, whoſe end damnation and hel.</hi> The loſſe of our fame (the thing itſelf ſpeaking) I need not long to diſcourſe of. Aſſuredly no vice makes vs more blush then this. By good right ought it to be ful of shame &amp; ignominy that hath ſo much madneſſe &amp; turpitude. Nor am I hard to belieue that many men are perfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diouſly ſtrucken dumbe at that time when this should be diſcouered in confeſſion;
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:10473:71"/>
and that the Sacrament of Pennance is not oftner violated by any thing, then by concealing this obſcene ſinne. O vgly ſinne, which not only inflicteſt, as other doe, a deadly wound vpon the ſinner, but alſo excludeſt the medicine, and only endeauoureſt that he, who hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited thee, may neuer be freed from thee. Neither is it ſufficient for thee to haue debilitated our body, purloined our money, broken our wit, dull'd our me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, killed our ſoule; but thou layeſt violent hands on our fame, and makeſt cruel hauocke of the treaſure of our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation and honeſty. Nor is this to be marueled at in the enemy of al vertues, and the friend of al vices. EDESIMVES. But as yet (my PARTHENIVS) thou haſt not fully proued thy laſt aſſertion. The vertues haue euery one their peculiar enemy: and in like manner the vices their proper aduerſary. PARTHENIVS. But I (my EDESIMVS) would haue thee make no difficulty of this. I wil not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract that which I haue ſaid, but with much eaſe make it appeare plainely vnto thee. Luſt ſo transformeth a man, that
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:10473:71"/>
he remaineth nothing leſſe then a man; but is a very beaſt, hauing fowly caſt-off humane nature. Giue me but one yong man that is a louer of that filthineſſe, and ſee if thou canſt find in him ſo much as one ſolid vertue. Where luſt domineereth, vertues are exiled. <hi>Horace</hi> in times paſt ſpeaking of a yong men who had gotten the bridle in his teeth, ſaid he was:
<q>

               </p>
               <p>This is moſt truly ſaid of a man that is polluted with ſordid obſcenities: he is as pliant as was not to one vice only, but to al in general. Firſt I thinke you wil not deny it, if I ſay they are ſubiect to pride, who deſire to become acceptable to laſciuious eyes, and make themſelues ſpruce, neate and beautiful, meerly by painting and ſlicking; which they chiefly doe to pleaſe and content others. But perhaps ſuch men as theſe ſee me not to be couetous. Let them alſo not be prodigal: but that they alwaies wil be, which is alſo no leſſe vicious and dishoneſt. Yea, which thou mayſt very wel ſay is a mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous

thing, they are often both couetous and prodigal. From ſome they couetouſly extort money to ſpend it prodigally vpon others. They robbe their parents to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow it vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their harlots. No man is igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant that venereous loue is ful of enuy. Would you haue me reharſe thoſe old cataſtrophes? The miſeries &amp; deſtruſtion of Troy? Yea the ouerthrow of diuers cittyes &amp; Kingdomes beſides, ſufficiently declares it. I need not ſpeake much of Gluttony. It is apparent that luſt is neuer without gluttony. And you shal neuer ſee more familiar friends, then co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cupiſcence and idleneſſe, ſlouth and venery. I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude with Tully, who in the perſon of Cato Maior recounteth the wordes of <hi>Architas Tarentinus</hi> in this manner: <hi>That there is no greater capital plague giuen vnto men by nature then the pleaſure of the body.</hi> And not long after he addeth: <hi>In the Kingdome of pleaſure vertue hath no reſidence.</hi> Wherefore nothing is ſo deteſtable and ſo peſtiferous as pleaſure: for when it is prolixe and durable, it extinguisheth al the light of the ſoule. But thou wilt giue more credit to Salomon then to <hi>Cicero,</hi> or

and barley. EDESIMVS. I ſee you come vpon me with a thouſand queſtions: PARTHENIVS. Doubt not, we wil find anſwers for them al.

who was not to be da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dled nor cockered, being elected Captaine General in ſo important a warfare.

No more certainely then <hi>Menelaus</hi> had to defend himſelfe from that shaft of <hi>Pandarus,</hi> who by ſtealth shot at him, lurking couertly amongſt his fellowes.

being a man equaly mortal with vs. But he only felt them, yealded not vnto them. He was ſenſible of the commotions in this inteſtine warre, but neuer departed from his ſtation, or timorouſly ſuffered himſelfe to be vanquished. He ſtood his ground, ioyn'd foot to foot, hand to hand with his aduerſary, and againſt himſelfe tryed his ſtrength, which can neuer be certainly ſecured of its owne ability, if many difficultyes doe not on euery ſide aſſault it. This is the trial, this that touch-ſtone of a reſolute mind indeed, that wil neuer giue backe or yeald to its enemy.

Behold how forward he is in this his proiect, how little he debateth the matter, how farre from being indulgent to his owne flesh.

And ſo likewiſe dideſt thou, (o <hi>Benedict</hi>) nay doubtles thou hadſt not remained Bleſſed, if thou hadſt not contemned that beatitude which the body falſly pretendeth to uſelfe: thou haſt ouercome the ſinne in punishing it. O you brambles no man hath leſſe cauſe to be ashamed of you, then <hi>Benedict!</hi> You may rather be ſaid to make <hi>Venus</hi> blush, &amp; be ashamed: it was she that came to ſow brambles, and was ouercome in the brambles. She brought flames from Mount <hi>Ida,</hi> to Mount <hi>Caſsmo,</hi> but with flames she was driuen away. The mind of <hi>Benedict</hi> was fired with pleaſures, but this fire was quenched with fire of bryars and ſtinging netties. Better was it for thoſe thornes freely to ranſack his veines, then that luſt entring into his bowels, should ſuck the very marrow from his bones.</p>

truly may I ſay, al the <hi>Cupids,</hi> how many ſoeuer inſulted ouer <hi>Benedict,</hi> departed from their conquerour with teares in their eyes deploring their diſaſtre. And this is called to this day the Bulwarke of Thiſtles, wherin this holy man diſarmed both himſelfe and his enemy, offered a taſt of his bloud to this thorny thicket, triumphed ouer <hi>Venus,</hi> and quenched the impure fire of concupiſcence. Thus that braue ſouldier by wounding his body cured his ſoule, not ſo much auoiding as changing his flames, and preſeruing the ſpirit, trampled vpon his flesh: for had he been indulgent to the one, he had proued a tyrant to the other. With wounds he preuented wounds, and with flames ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguished flames. He expoſed his body to be torne by angry briars, that he might preſerue his ſoule from blaſting. And had he not inflicted wounds on his body, there had been deeper gashes made in his ſoule; and this he could not haue cured, vnles he had firſt wounded the other. A maruelous kind of healing by impairing the health, and a new kind of gaining by ſuffering ſome loſſe. Although
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:10473:85"/>
truly heer was no loſſe, vnles it were of durt mixed with bloud; to wit of his body.</p>
                  <p>And can there be any loſſe of this body, which, as witneſſeth <hi>Solon,</hi> when it is borne, is nothing but putrefaction, whilſt it liueth a beaſt in conſtitution, and when it dieth, no other then wormes meat? Can it (I ſay) be any loſſe to punish this, that is no better then a beaſt, or beaſts meats? How ſmal a thing is this, or rather nothing in reſpect of the victory obtained thereby. He ouercometh twice, that ouercometh himſelfe. And I adde moreouer, there can not be a more plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing nor more profitable victory then that a man obtaineth ouer himſelfe.

               <p>Bleſſed <hi>S. Bernard,</hi> a Prelate of a ſingular wit, and admirable learning, wrote many excellent, and ſome in a manner diuine things: and it is ſaid of him, he was neuer taught by any maiſter: but by the only practiſe of prayer &amp; reading, he aſcended to this height of knowledge. His deſire of vnderſtanding inuited him to read, his prayer obtained vnderſtanding; but the meanes whereby he obtained it was ſanctity of life. Thus let a man deſire,

of that <hi>B. Anthony</hi> perſwaded two of the court of <hi>Theodoſius</hi> the Emperour to a more holy courſe of life, with a change as ſpeedy as admirable. They were deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to ſpend ſome howers of the afternoone in walking. And as they wandred in the open fields, to auoid the heate, retired themſelues into a little monaſtery, and at leaſure viewed the poore furniture of the houſe. Heer by chance one of them tooke into his hand that life of <hi>B. Anthony</hi> written at large. Curioſity perſwaded him at firſt to open and looke vpon it, and deuotion after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward (for the better ſpending of his time) to read it: Firſt of al he is ſtrucken with admiration: ſometimes he makes a pauſe, and meditates a little, then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnes to be delighted; by degrees he is drawne, and by little &amp; little infla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med. To conclude, this Courtier was ſo enkindled by reading, that caſting his eyes vpon his fellow, he ſaid: I pray thee, what is the vtmoſt ambition of al our labours? Al our hope aymes no higher, then at the Emperours fauour; and how long wil that continue?

Through how many da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gers doe we trauel to a greater danger? We are the world's bondſlaues, and oftentimes become the diuels Martyrs, and after we haue ſpent the flower of our youth, our health and life, vpon this vaine trifling, what gaine we thereby? I wil become the freind of God now whilſt I am able. Thus he ſpake and began againe to read, ſeriouſly pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering in his mind with a hard conflict. At laſt cryed out: I haue broken through, I haue now determined. I wil begin this very houre, and in this place ſerue my God. Then turning to his fellow, he ſaid: May it pleaſe you, Sir, to ioyne with me, and follow my example? At leaſt op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe not; for you shal find me no change<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling. Vnto whom the other replied: I wil be your inſeparable companion: I wil ſtil follow you.

                  <p>Behold, my EDESIMVS, how powerfully pious reading preuailes. It is a moſt true ſaying of <hi>S. Auguſtine: When we read God talketh with vs.</hi> He that profiteth nothing by reading, let him not ſay that God ſpeakes not to him, but that he attends not to God.</p>
                  <p>According to the things a man reades is the profit he reapes: thoſe things we read ſhould not be ſo prolixe as profitable. I doe not ſay that <hi>Maro</hi> or <hi>Cicero</hi> should abſolutly be abandoned; but that <hi>Thomas a Kempis</hi> &amp; other pious Writers should be likewiſe peruſed; leſt with <hi>S.

PAR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>THENIVS. I allow of your iudgement; we should not read to pleaſe our taſt, but to reape fruit; nor to become learned, but vertuous therby. Infinit is the number of pious books in this our Age, and yet they daily increaſe. But behold I giue you a very briefe Catalogue of thoſe I thinke more profitable then a thouſand others, both for youth, riper age, and for men in yeares.

Moreouer <hi>Variety,</hi> for the moſt part, in al reading, is vtterly to be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>demned. The multitude of diſhes impaires the health of many, who otherwiſe would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly enioy it. Multiplicity of medicines shortneth the life of many ſicke men. So in like ſort variety and exceſſe in reading hindreth the proficient in ſolid vertue. The reading of al manner of bookes cauſeth a certaine confuſion and inſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of mind. That man who is euery where, is no where; nor is it wholeſome to take diuers ſorts of different me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines. It is the property of a queaſy ſtomacke to be ſtil taſting ſeueral meats; which being of ſo diſtinct and diuers quality, corrupt rather then nourish. Many dishes beget many diſeaſes: ſo in like manner, it is a fault in a reader, to ſeeke in bookes rather his pleaſure then his profit. <hi>Polibius</hi> compareth theſe men to licorish fellowes, and glurtonous Epicures, who taſting heer and there a bit of al ſorts of meats, ſet before them, haue little or no pleaſure for the preſent, nor future nourishment or profit. Let vs ſo read (my EDESIMVS) that we not

Ah (my EDESIMVS) not our ſcience but our practiſe shal be approued of in heauen. To what end doe I read much, if I neuer purpoſe to put any thing in practiſe? What doth it auaile vs to read ſacred and practiſe prophane things? Why are pious bookes daily in our hands, if we haue not ſo much as the very shadow of piety in our liues? Why doe I entertaine my mind with the precepts of chaſtity, if I refuſe to put them in practiſe? When we begin to read, we ought to haue an ingenuous and firme determination to execute in each reſpect whatſoeuer a pious booke by diuine inſpiration shal dictate either to be followed or eſchew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.

From a little child this <hi>Godefrey</hi> was accuſtomed to weare haire-cloth both day and night, and that for whole weekes together. He sharply diſciplin'd himſelf vpon fridayes, ſaturdayes, the Eues of Chriſtmaſſe, al the Eues of the moſt Bleſſed Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> and vpon the Eue of his particular Patron. Al the time he performed the office of a Bishop, he ſlept only vpon ſtraw couered with a sheet; many nightes he lay vpon the bare ground, couered only with a courſe cloth; and many times at mid-night roſe to his vſual prayers. Beſides (which is not impertinent to our purpoſe) al fridayes and ſaturdayes he abſtained from meate,
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:10473:111"/>
contenting himſelfe with a little draught of drinke and one only morſel of bread. If at any time vpon theſe dayes, hoſpita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, or ſome other cauſe drew him to the table, piouſly to diſſemble the conſtant rigour of his abſtinence, he tooke meate from the caruer, as if he would haue eaten it, and anon after, when he might doe it with the leaſt obſeruation of others, as if his mind had been vpon ſome other matter, he gaue it away vntouched to his ſeruant. Vpon Good friday and diuers other times in the yeare he taſted nothing els but bread and water. This he did moſt when he perceaued himſelf leaſt noted of others. In the faſt of Lent he neither eat fish, not any ſuch like things, contenting himſelfe only with herbes, peaſe, beanes, or rape-rootes: throughout al the dayes of Aduent he neuer eat any flesh. Certainely ſincere loue of chaſtity was of no ſmal eſteeme with him: which how highly he prized, by this that followeth may very plainely appeare.</p>
                  <p>In his youth he was of comely coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, and wel fauoured; but ſo that
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:10473:111"/>
beauty &amp; modeſty made a noble mixture together. The diuel by this ſtratageme vndertooke to lay ſiege to his virginal chaſtity. Diuers women of note by the extraordinary beauty of this yong man drawne to affect him immodeſtly, vnder an honourable pretext inuited him to a feaſt: who refuſed not to come, but (that he might as wel be free from danger, as ſuſpicion) brought with him his Tutour; whom before al others they plied with wine, hauing by wicked ſubtilty conſpired that he aboue the reſt should be leaſt able to depart from the houſe, and conſequently compelled together with the yong man, committed to his charge, to take vp his lodging there. The matter ſucceeded accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly; ſo that ſoundly tipled. ſtagge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring and reeling, they commanded him to be laid to ſleep in the next cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber. This yong man was alſo hindred from departing that night: and ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting no euil ſuffered himſelfe to be brought to a bedde fit for ſuch a gueſt. But the night being farre ſpent, the youth faſt aſleep, and al thinges in

deepe ſilence, theſe Furyes enflamed with luſt, ſtole ſecretly into his chamber, and approaching neere his bedde both by wordes and impudent geſtures prouoked him to luſt. Whereupon this chaſt yong man, frighted as is were with the ſight of ſo many Stygian Monſters, awaked, and ſtraight with horrour crying out, leap'd forth of his bedde clothed as he was with linnen breeches, &amp; a ſhirt vpon his back, and ſo ſaued himſelfe from thoſe impure hands; leauing al his apparel behind him, and flying out of that treacherous houſe, betooke himſelfe for refuge vnto the next neighbours, as to a ſanctuary, where he ſpent the reſidue of the night in prayers &amp; thanks-giuing for the victory he had obtained in defence of his chaſtity. O fact worthy of eternal recordes! O <hi>Nicetas,</hi> there are ſome willing to fight thy combate, though perhaps if they had thy oppoſites they could neuer come away with the victory. O <hi>Ioſeph,</hi> thou Aegyptian Vice-Roy, acknowledge heer one that emulates thy vertue<hi>!</hi> O my EDESIMVS heere I preſent thee euen with <hi>Nicetas</hi> himſelfe ſuruiuing in this yong man.

could eaſily be perſwaded that <hi>Godefry,</hi> after ſo noble a victory, obtained of God the ſame fauour, which <hi>Thomas Aquinas</hi> did; whoſe loynes the Angels girded in ſuch ſort that he afterward felt no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion in his fleſh, or if he did, eaſily ſuppeſs'd it. Nor did he for al this liue ſo ſecure and careleſſe as to confide in his owne chaſtity, but ſtil was prouident and circumſpect, fearing the diuels ſubtiltyes. He knew very wel what we ſpake of before; that a virgin neuer giues ouer warfare. Therefore being inuited another time to a ſuſpected houſe, he ſaid he had rather goe to an hoſpital, and ſuppe amongſt lepers, then only enter into thoſe houſes to hazard his chaſtity, and willingly caſt himſelf headlong into the fire. Neither did he otherwiſe then he ſaid; and giuing an auſtere example of vertue, perpetually eſtabliſhed his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinency, being ingenious in ſeeking diuers punishments for his body. His cuſtome was to weare an iron girdle ful of sharp prickles buckled cloſe aboue his naked loynes. His very bracelets, if at any time he wore them, were no inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments

To which the yong man thus replyed: But (Father) I am weake and hardly able to reſiſt, the temptations ſtrong and violent; wherefore I am ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come and forced to yeald. But none (ſaid the old man) are ouercome in this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate, but they that are willing.

This yong man, taken in theſe ſtraights, began to bend al the weapons he had againſt the enemy. Sometimes he called vpon his Patro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; anon he endeauoured to ſigne his hart with the ſigne of the croſſe, but this was almoſt in vaine, for both his hand and his thumb was benum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med and deſtitute of ſtrength. At laſt his tongue relieued him; ſo that cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling vpon God, his hands returned to their proper office; and the shapes of thoſe Syrens vanished into ſmoake. Yet was not the fire quenched at their departure; but the yong man burned ſtil with liuing flames, whereupon he rushed out of his bedde, and falling flat on the ground began to punish
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:10473:118"/>
himſelfe, and when he had laine there for the ſpace of an houre, triumphed ouer thoſe impure flames.<note place="margin">

in vaine; vanished into ayre: and their ſonne was more confirmed and ſetled in his determinate purpoſe. Therefore to ruinate this wal, it was to be shaken with a more forcible engine. Satan was not wanting, but alwaies moſt vigilant to prouoke them. <hi>S. Thomas</hi> thought him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe ſecure alone in his chamber, which he afterwards perceaued was a dangerous priſon. For thither was ſent a woman more remarkeable for beauty then mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty, diſcouering wantonneſſe in her very lookes, who began with many faire and laſciuious allurements to inuite to lewdneſſe this modeſt yong man.

                  <p>But <hi>Ioſaphat</hi> had not yet paſſed al his dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger: a sharper and farre more perillous combate was at hand.

This Lady was laid, by the ſtrong endeauours of the Kings Magitian, as the chief foundation of this tragedy: who to make himſelfe more ſecure of the victory, by a Magick ſpel conueyed a wicked ſpirit into her, fortifying heerby theſe combinations in ſuch ſort, that there might be no poſsibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of euaſion. The diuel therefore comes performed vnder that comely shape, and to affaile more cruelly, began by flattery
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:10473:121"/>
at the firſt. The damſel inſtructed by diuelish ſubtilty, to deceaue as much as poſsibly she could, craftily fain'd her ſelfe very deſirour to embrace the Chriſtian re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. Satan, that hellish fisher, fix't that baite on his hooke, which he knew ſuch kind of fiſches moſt earneſtly ſought after. Yong <hi>Ioſaphat,</hi> thinking this an excellent occaſion to ſaue a ſoule from damnation, ſaid, he deſired nothing more, then that many might with him be conuerted from Idolatry to the faith of Chriſt. Wherupon ſpeeches paſſed on both ſides. The yong maid, quaintly faining her ſelfe to be ouercome, &amp; by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees to condeſcend &amp; yeald to the truth, ſaid there should be no want in her, she would willingly (if he vouchſafed to take her to wife) be baptized and embrace the Chriſtian faith: that she wanted only the fortune and not the bloud or deſcent of a Queene: but she was of opinion, the Chriſtians not ſo much eſteemed the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, as the mind and vertues for a dowry. That her Father, grand-father, great grand-father and their anceſtours were Kinges. That their royal eſtate was by
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:10473:121"/>
warre ſomewhat impaired: but neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theles belieued (ſeing she brought vertue) she should not come without a portion to him that would make her his wife. Alas <hi>Ioſaphat,</hi> alas! thou wert neuer in more danger to be vtterly vndone. The poore yong man ſtood aſtonished, and in ſilence commended and admired her prudent &amp; graceful ſpeech: and, as it hapneth to men vpon ſuch tearmes, often caſt his eyes (which now began to forget their wonted recollection) vpon the ſpeakers face, who to perſwade him not to haue ſo great auerſion from honeſt mariage, began to alleadge, I know not what ſentences out of the Goſpel, (which she had learned of her Maiſter the diuel) as namely that by Chriſts owne preſence mariages were commended. She extolled honourable mariage, and an immaculate bedde. To conclude, brought many things in commendation of wedlocke.</p>
                  <p>To gaze on her, and liſten to her elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, and not to be perſwaded, muſt rather proceed from dluine power, then the frailty of a man. Euen ſilent beauty it ſelf, is a moſt eloquent Oratour, with
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:10473:122"/>
prowerful charmes euicting whatſoeuer it wil. When it hath once powred forth its hony intermixt with elegant termes, the mind ouercome with allurements is eaſily perſwaded. Hitherto <hi>Ioſaphat</hi> againſt al the violence of luſt ſeemed a ſtone, an vnmoueable rock: but this laſciuious diuel with impure flames had ſo power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully enuironed this bulwarke, that it began like fleeting ſand to be weakened and moulder away. <hi>Ioſaphat</hi> was not as yet ouercome, notwithſtanding the victory was doubtful; for he began to be turmoiled with perplexities of mind, who before had determined to reſerue his body free from touch of any woman.

                  <p>O my <hi>Ioſaphat,</hi> this is not to gaine ſoules; thou rather art in danger by ſeeking to gaine anothers, to betray thyne owne; thou knoweſt wel that ſaying:<note place="margin">

                  <p>Certaine it is that many very holy men, who otherwiſe had periſhed, haue been ſaued in wedlock. But 'tis no leſſe credible that many haue periſhed in wedlock, who had been ſaued without it.</p>

Ah if this vehement conflict of mind continue any longer, I am not able to indure it. Leaue this to God's prouidence, let vs indure that which God wil haue vs to day, and he wil haue care of vs to morrow. But what? shal I leaue that poore wreched maid ſtil in the iawes of the hellish dragon? On the otherſide haſt thou already forgotten into what dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers thou wert falling by the familiarity of women? Thou haſt ſcarcely eſcaped, and do'ſt deſire againe to run into them? None can better iudge of perils then they that haue tryed them. Notwithſtanding it is the part of a Chriſtian to be careful of anothers ſaluation; but before al of his owne.

Speedy confeſsion affordes ſpeedy remedy. And this is the firſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant reaſon to moue vs to frequent confeſsion. I wil giue you another.</p>
               <p>We are continually expoſed to infinit dangers of offending God. Our knowne enimyes, the diuel, the flesh, and the world (albeit we withſtand the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> neuer ſo much) ſuggeſt, draw, perſwade, allure, and daily importune vs; but they only draw, they cannot compel vs; their ſpecial endeauour (to the end we not may become good and vertuous men, nor carefully obſerue the ſtaynes and ſpots of our conſcience) is to perſwade vs to be ſlack and negligent in
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:10473:125"/>
washing them away. What meaneſt thou (ſay theſe our deceauers) to haue ſo nice &amp; tender a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſcience? Thou wilt ſtil haue enough to doe, thou shalt neuer want buſines nor trouble; there wil alwayes be ſomething to wipe away, nor shalt thou euer haue any end of thy labours. Doſt thou not heer perceaue what thine ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies goe about? Theſe are the ſecret counſels of the diuel in the diſguiſe of a Freind. If thou wouldeſt not be damnified by theſe pernicious ſuggeſtions, make the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> preſently knowne. He that layes open the ſecrets of his freind looſeth his credit. The diuel faineth freindiship with thee: thou shalt eaſily be rid of this masked freind, if thou diſcloſe al his ſecrets by frequent co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

                  <hi>the Sacrament worketh in vs. It extennates the difficulty in reſisting ſmal ſinnes, and in greater preuents and hindreth our conſent.</hi> The Councel of <hi>Trent</hi> affirmeth that they, who with due preparation participate of this Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, are preſerued from yealding
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:10473:126"/>
to temptation, and with facility proceed warily and vigilant in the way of vertue. Theſe are the wordes of the Councel: <hi>But the difficulty itſelf of this kind of confeſsion, and shame of diſcloſing our ſinnes, might without doubt ſeeme very great, were it not that ſo many benefits and conſolations, worthily concurring with this Sacrament, are by abſolution certainly bestowed vpon vs.</hi> Experience, itſelf is a ſufficient witneſſe, ſith in thoſe cityes, where the Sacrament of Confeſſion is frequented, we ſee many ſpend the whole courſe of their life without any great or heynous crime.</p>
               <p>I wil likewiſe adde a third reaſon why a mans conſcience ought to be purged with often confeſſion. We are ſo enlightned by this Sacrament of Pennance, that our ſinnes, and the original cauſes of them, are farre more eaſily diſcerned. The be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of ſaluation is the knowledge of ſinne. Of which he that is ignorant wil not be corrected. It is requiſite thou shouldeſt find thy ſelfguilty, before thou goeſt about to amend thy fault. Some men glory in their impietyes, and how is it poſsible they should haue any thought
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:10473:126"/>
of remedy, when they number their vices in lieu of vertues? Therefore as much as thou canſt accuſe thy ſelfe: looke into thyne owne conſcience. Firſt performe the office of an accuſer; then of a iudge; and laſtly ſue for pardon. Sometimes likewiſe doe that which is repugnant vnto thyne owne wil. It is the prayer of that Kingly Prophet:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pſal.</hi> 12.4.</note> 
                  <hi>Illuminate mine eyes, that I neuer ſleep in death; least at any time mine enemy ſay I haue peruailed against him.</hi> Publike ſermons, if they moue any one in particular to amendment of life, in this reſpect they moue the leſſe, for that they ayme at mouing the whole audience: but thoſe admonitions which are giuen by a ghoſtly father for the auoiding of vices, ſupply the place of a ſermon, which are ſo much more effectual, in regard they are deliuered to direct and guide but one in particular. Warre is begun &amp; managed in due order, and there shal be ſaluation where many counſels are. Thy warre in the defence of chaſtity wil not long be ſucceſſeful vnles thou diſpoſe thy ſelfe thereunto by often confeſſion; wherin thou mayſt likewiſe take aduiſe how
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:10473:127"/>
with dexterity to ouercome the enemy of chaſtity, which is a very crafty and in a manner a domeſtical enemy. And be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured thou neuer ſtandeſt more in need of preſent and mature counſel then in this conflict, which is ſo ſecret and inteſtine.</p>

                  <p>Wil you haue the fift reaſon? He that refuſeth to be wary, shal neuer be chaſt. You shal ſee for the moſt part, thoſe that are the warieſt are the chaſteſt. Chaſtity and modeſty are more tender and fraile then Venice glaſſe; with the leaſt knock that may be, they are either crazed or broken. But the moſt neceſſary cautions for the preſeruation of this cryſtal veſſel, are chiefly taught by frequent confeſsion. Therefore the diuel, that Maiſter ſo ful of fraudes and ſubtilties, ſo much laboureth to make confeſsion grieuous and hateful vnto vs. He obiecteth tediouſneſſe, interpoſeth buſineſſe, alleadgeth diuers things, and leaueth nothing vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>attempted, that our Confeſsion may be ſeldome and coldly performed. Theſe (ſaith this crafty impoſtor) are but ſmal matters: what need haſt thou to be ſo feareful of trifles? What a butchery
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:10473:128"/>
of conſcience wilt thou make, if euery, little moat be ſo ſcrupulouſly picked out But beware (my child) of the leaſt ſinnes, if thou wouldeſt not fal into greater. <hi>He that contemnes ſmal things, shal fal by little and little.</hi>

                  <p>Vnto this I alſo adioyne the next reaſon. The ioy &amp; peace of conſcience is by no meanes otherwiſe to be procured then by frequent confeſſion. <hi>Al things,</hi> (ſaith <hi>S. Bernard</hi>)<note place="margin">

This ſenſe is not ſatisfyed when the body is clothed, but it muſt haue ſoft apparel; nor is it content to lye when it sleepes, but it muſt haue a downe-bed. This is the principal care of touching, to find al things ſoft and ſmooth; and that, as we may eaſily perceaue, only for it's pleaſure. But this hath been condemned long ſince by Chriſt our Sauiour: <hi>Behold</hi> (ſaith he)<note place="margin">

King. And he commended <hi>Iohn</hi> the ſonne of <hi>Zachary,</hi> who liu'd about the riuer <hi>Iordan</hi> not for his ſoft, but for his rough &amp; hairy garment. Nor would <hi>S.

                  <p>Modeſty is beſt pleaſed with plaine &amp; neat attire. For the moſt part, the ſoft and rich garments are moſt vſed where mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty is leaſt eſteemed.

it content itſelf, or thinke it can ſleep ſoundly, except it may lye deeply drow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in a feather-bed. Beginning with theſe principles it goes on to embrace a more licentious liberty; and at laſt, grown more impudent, infringeth the lawes of modeſty. But too much in a manner is the very name of shameleſſe touchings, embracings and kiſſes. I haue ſaid enough, and perhaps it wil be more ſecure to reprehend theſe dishoneſties with only naming them. Thou muſt be wary, yea very warily muſt thou behaue thy ſelfe heerin (my EDESIMVS) if thou wilt liue chaſtly.

                  <p>The principal and moſt deſperate prouocation to al miſchiefe is to beleeue that a man is not marked or ſeen. Doe but aske any theef, how he durſt commit ſo many thefts ſo boldly and without feare; he wil anſwer you: I thought I was not ſeen nor obſerued. Goe likewiſe to an adulterer, and demand how he dares enter into another man's houſe, and moſt dishoneſtly violate his wife; and whether, if he haue no feare of God, he dare alſo neglect the punishment the Magiſtrate may inflict He wil anſwer fearefully: I thought none should haue known it. I wil ſend you to others. Goe priuately to a man giuen to detraction, and finding him curſe his Maſter with al the execrable words that he can; aske againſt whom he diſgorgeth al thoſe virulent ſpeeches; and he ſtrooke with terrour wil anſwer you: I thought I had been alone, &amp; that no body had heard me. This is the ready way to hel; for a man to liue, as if no eye ſaw him or obſerued his actions.

it is moſt meet a man should in al his courſes incite himſelf in this manner: <hi>Attende tibi,</hi> looke to thy ſelfe. PARTHE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NIVS. You ſay wel. But behold (my EESIMVS) how farre a man is tranſported by corrupt affection, and laſciuious appetite, how he is ſeduced from that faith? A man that is impure and prone to carnal luſt (which is the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty of al other vices) hath only theſe two principles before his eyes; the wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonneſſe of his flesh, and the knowledge of his faith and religion. Concupiſcence wil haue theſe things practiſed which it moſt deſires: but faith wil not admit them; aſſuredly affirming that God ſeeth al things. Wherefore rather then he wil forſake his vicious luſt, he abandons his faith, and to become an adulterer, ipſo facto proues an hereticke. The like hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth when he is delighted with laſciuious thoughts, and yet is not ignorant that Almighty God is thereof an eye-witnes. Behold heer faith againe and againe pricketh, gauleth, and admonisheth him in this manner: God ſeeth thoſe things which thou thinkeſt; Almighty God

So (poore ſoule) he goeth forward, and forſaking or burying his faith, he retaineth and cherisheth thoſe moſt ſordid thoughts &amp; imaginations, and finding them in shew pleaſing and beautiful, dallies with them, and with obſcene delights workes his owne ruine and deſtruction. To this miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chieuous diſaſter and down-fal he is ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated by that foolish &amp; impious ſaying: <hi>Nemo me videt,</hi> No body ſeeth me.

The Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour was then in a chamber, not farre from the market-place, where certaine ſhewes were prepared. When the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate of the citty was departed thence, the luſts and Tourniaments began. The moſt part of the Courtiers tooke their
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:10473:182"/>
places where they could beſt accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date themſelues. The Emperour attended with a ſmal company followed, leauing the golden goblet vpon the table, and the doores open through which he had paſs'd. Now, while al were attentiue to the ſports, one of the houshould ſeruants entred ſecretly into the Emperour's chamber; I imagin to take account (but for his owne purſe) of thoſe peeces of gold: therefore he laid hold of the cup, and imagining no body ſaw him, with no ſparing hand tooke out a great part of the gold. In the meane while the Emperour priuately put his <hi>Phengites</hi> before his eyes, &amp; beheld therein what was done behind his backe, and withal the theefe then in action. The Emperour returning to the chamber, where euery one earneſtly expected the diſtribution of the preſent, commanded his ſeruants to take out their equal shares. Amongſt the reſt the man, who had been there before he was inui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, was called and commanded to take out as much as he could wel hould in his hand. At the firſt he ſeemed backward, but in the end without shame tooke out
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:10473:183"/>
his share. Which done, the Emperour bad him number the peeces, and withal commanded him to draw forth thoſe he had taken away whil'ſt he was abſent. Let vs ſee (ſaid he) whether now or before thou haſt dealt moſt for thine owne ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantage. The poore man was euen ſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken dead, &amp; began to ſtammer, tremble, ſcarcely able to ſpeake a ready word, and beſought his Highnes to pardo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his offe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce. At laſt with shame enough he drew forth the peeces of gold and numbred them, which were farre more then the other he had taken.

In deluding this blind buzzard (ſaid the mule) there was not ſo much art as fortune. Woe be to thee when my Maſter comes: he hath <hi>Lincies</hi> eyes; if thou canſt deceaue him then thou maiſt triumph.
